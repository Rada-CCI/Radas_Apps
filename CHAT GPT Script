Create GUI for this application with the following inputs:
1. "Customer Name" - this should be an text input field 
2. "Type of Computer" - This should be a dropdown box with the following inputs: "Console" ; "Laptop" ; "Rack PC" ; "Desktop".
3. "Serial Number" - This should be a number input only field
4. "Custom Name" - This should be a text input field with the following limitations
     - 15 characters max
     - no special characters except for "-" and "_"
     - Any spaces are converted to "-"

Below the inputs needs to be a text display labelled "New Comptuer Name"that will do one of the follow:
1. combine the first three input fields and assign a "-" to any spaces using the following format: [Customer Name]-[Type of Computer]-[Serial Number]
     - The [Type of Computer] output should be a single character with the following scheme:
          - "Console"="C"
          - "Laptop"="L"
          - "Rack PC"="R"
          - "Desktop"="D"
2. If there is any input into the "Custome Name" field, disregard the first three boxes and use only the text entered into the "Custom Name" field.

Once a name has been generated, a button called "Accept new computer name" should become available. Once this button is pressed, there needs to be a confirmation window. If confirmed "Ok", change the computer name to the "New Computer Name"




make a copy of the current background image and imbed into the program as the default background. Add a small preview section so the user can see what the background will change to.

Adjust the application window size so that everything fits by default. Allow the application window to be resized, maximized and minimized.
